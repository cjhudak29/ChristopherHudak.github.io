<!--Requirement 1 is met in my index.html file and page2.html file.
		Requirement 2 is met in each file in my footer tag where I site where my knowledge came from. I also include an external link in page3.html under the graduation cap image where I cite my source.
		Requirement 3 is met in each file by using the ‘header’, ‘nav’, ‘section’, ‘aside’, and ‘div’ tags. ‘Section’ is used to group the content of my respective pages while the ‘div’ tag is being used to group subsections within the ‘section’ tag.
		Requirement 4 is met on each page with unique photos per page; index.html includes a photo of myself, page2.html include an image of coffee brewing, and page3.html includes a photo of a graduation cap
		Requirement 5 is met on page2.html where I include a table with tabular data of my educational enrollment history.
		Requirement 6 is met in my navigation tag on each page as well as my interests page where I create an unordered list of my track & field achievements.
		Requirement 7 is met in my ‘nav’ tag on each page.
		Requirement 8 is met in my page2.html file where I embed a YouTube video of my mobile photography inspiration. The traditional ‘embed’ tag was not functioning correctly. After some research, I found that iframe and its respective attributes enabled playback on my page.

			<p>This site consists strictly of HTML coding. As I progress through the course, I will build upon this
				assignment and add styling with CSS and JavaScript functionality. What you see below may change
				locations throughout the site, or <i>may</i> not make it into the final version.</p>

			<h3>Running</h3>
			<p> Running is a passion I built on when I was 13. I have 10 years of competitive experience in track &
				field, competing as high as the collegiate level in the NCAA Division. My main event was high jump.
				Below is a list of some of my highest achievements: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Place 3rd in the <b>CTC Indoor Track & Field Championships</b> (2016)</li>
				<li>Place 2nd in the <b>Skyland Conference Track & Field Relay Championship</b> (2015)</li>
				<li>Place 4th in the <b>NJSIAA Sectional Championships - Central Gr. 1&4</b> (2015)</li>
				<li>Place 1st in the <b>Skyland Conference Track & Field Relay Championship</b> (2014)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Photography</h3>
			<p> I think about photography every day. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of mobile photography with my
				iPhone. Whether I am capturing a moment in time with family & friends, or trying to get the perfect shot
				of a landscape, I enjoy the process of shooting and editing my photos. I continue to improve and try new
				things in my edits. In future implementations of this site, I will include a photo gallery page to
				showcase some of my work.
				<br> I really favor over mobile Photography. It's fast, easy, convenient, and the results I get are
				above and beyond my expectations. Below is one of many video inspirations that influenced my choice to
				pursue mobile photography.

			<h3>Games</h3>
			<p> I enjoy turn-based games. From playing a round of chess with a colleague to a childhood-classic Pokemon
				battle with my friends, I love to strategize and progress through a series of steps to win against my
				opponent. I am a very technical thinker. </p>

			<h3>Coffee</h3>
			<p> I saved the best for last: coffee. I can never have too much coffee. I love the taste, smell, and
				process of creating coffee. In future implementations when I use CSS, I will design this site to have a
				coffee-related aesthetic with fitting fonts and color palette. </p> <img src="./images/image2.jpg"
