<!--Requirement 1 is met in my index.html file and page2.html file.
		Requirement 2 is met in each file in my footer tag where I site where my knowledge came from. I also include an external link in page3.html under the graduation cap image where I cite my source.
		Requirement 3 is met in each file by using the ‘header’, ‘nav’, ‘section’, ‘aside’, and ‘div’ tags. ‘Section’ is used to group the content of my respective pages while the ‘div’ tag is being used to group subsections within the ‘section’ tag.
		Requirement 4 is met on each page with unique photos per page; index.html includes a photo of myself, page2.html include an image of coffee brewing, and page3.html includes a photo of a graduation cap
		Requirement 5 is met on page2.html where I include a table with tabular data of my educational enrollment history.
		Requirement 6 is met in my navigation tag on each page as well as my interests page where I create an unordered list of my track & field achievements.
		Requirement 7 is met in my ‘nav’ tag on each page.
		Requirement 8 is met in my page2.html file where I embed a YouTube video of my mobile photography inspiration. The traditional ‘embed’ tag was not functioning correctly. After some research, I found that iframe and its respective attributes enabled playback on my page.
