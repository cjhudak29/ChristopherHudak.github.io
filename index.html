        <h2 align="center">Bio</h2>
        <p class="bio">
            I’m a recent graduate from DeSales University with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I like to code programs and websites in individual / team-oriented environments. My skills include object-oriented programming, agile / scrum methodology, and a variety of coding languages. In my downtime, I’m very physically active and love mobile photography. It’s important to me to be a well-rounded skilled person in a number of areas and to always keep myself busy.
